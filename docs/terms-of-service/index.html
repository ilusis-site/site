We reserve  the right to provide     information that you have provided to us and which could be used to  identify you personally to a third party if we are legally required to  do so.     Otherwise, however, we will not disclose such information to any  third party without your consent. We agree to comply with all laws that  relate to how your     personal information can be used.</p>
